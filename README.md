## Project Overview

In a period marked by persistent inflation and shifting consumer behavior, understanding public sentiment toward grocery prices has become a critical challenge for economists, businesses, and policymakers alike. Price volatility directly impacts the budgets of millions of families, influences consumer support and confidence, and shapes policy decisions at the government level. Understanding what economic factors exactly drive changes in consumer sentiment can provide individuals with answers to commonly overlooked behavioral and emotional patterns in response to grocery inflation. Developing a predictive model that integrates economic and behavioral data can help explain how people perceive and react to the constantly changing prices at the store. By comparing these patterns with consumer price indexes and predicting sentiment analysis, our project addresses the gap between economic data and public perception, creating a more responsive, forward-looking understanding of consumer attitudes.
